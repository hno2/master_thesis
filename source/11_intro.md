# Introduction, with a citation

## Background

I like big buts and I cannot lie.


To include a reference, add the citation key shown in the references.bib file.


To include a citation to the text, just add the citation key shown in the references.bib file. The style of the citation is determined by the ref_format.csl file. For example, in The Living Sea you can find pictures of the Calypso [@Cousteau1963].

In neque mauris, maximus at sapien a, iaculis dignissim justo. Aliquam erat volutpat. Praesent varius risus auctor est ultricies, sit amet consequat nisi laoreet. Suspendisse non est et mauris pharetra sagittis non porta justo. Praesent malesuada metus ut sapien sodales ornare.

## The middle bit

This is the middle bit. Phasellus quis ex in ipsum pellentesque lobortis tincidunt sed massa. Nullam euismod sem quis dictum condimentum. Suspendisse risus metus, elementum eu congue quis, viverra ac metus. Donec non lectus at lectus euismod laoreet pharetra semper dui. Donec sed eleifend erat, vel ultrices nibh. Nam scelerisque turpis ac nunc mollis, et rutrum nisl luctus.

Duis faucibus vestibulum elit, sit amet lobortis libero. Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per inceptos himenaeos. Sed at cursus nibh. Sed accumsan imperdiet interdum. Proin id facilisis tortor. Proin posuere a neque nec iaculis. Suspendisse potenti. Nullam hendrerit ante mi, vitae iaculis dui laoreet eu.

Cras eleifend velit diam, eu viverra mi volutpat ut. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. Donec finibus leo nec dui imperdiet, tincidunt ornare orci venenatis. Maecenas placerat efficitur est, eu blandit magna hendrerit eu.

### Subsection of the middle bit

This is a subsection of the middle bit. Quisque sit amet tempus arcu, ac suscipit ante. Cras massa elit, pellentesque eget nisl ut, malesuada rutrum risus. Nunc in venenatis mi. Curabitur sit amet suscipit eros, non tincidunt nibh. Phasellus lorem lectus, iaculis non luctus eget, tempus non risus. Suspendisse ut felis mi.

## Summary of chapters

For italic, add _ on either side of the text
For bold, add ** on either side of the text
For bold and italic, add _** on either side of the text


This is a brief outline of what went into each chapter, and a section which shows how to reference headers (which are labelled automatically for you). This chapter, +@sec:introduction-with-a-citation, shows how to use citations and how to reference section headers. \*@sec:literature-review-with-maths shows how use and reference equations. \*@sec:first-research-study-with-code shows how to use and reference code. \*@sec:research-containing-a-figure shows how to use, reference, and resize pdf and jpg figures. \*@sec:research-containing-a-table shows how to use and reference tables. \*@sec:final-research-study is truly revolutionary (but shows nothing functional). **[Appendix 1](#appendix-1-some-extra-stuff)** shows how to add chapters which are not numbered, and has to be referenced manually, as does **[Appendix 2](#appendix-2-some-more-extra-stuff)**. See the base [`README.md`](https://github.com/tompollard/phd_thesis_markdown/blob/master/README.md) for how References are handled - leave `*_references.md` alone, and provide it to `pandoc` last.

# A global pandemic and MOOCs - a perspective on learning new skills virtually

With a global pandemic making learning in person impossible, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) have seen a spike in popularity. The Vision of MOOCS is simple: Let learners across all ages, countries, and walks of life gain new skills by learning virtually. A life-long, life-accompanying on-demand learning fueled by the democratization of education. 

But this promise of breaking down obstacles is often broken. In reality, most courses are created top-down with the teacher in the center and lack real human interaction, especially when providing assessment and feedback. [@yousef2015effective]

Evaluating Assignments by using automatic tools is already widely used in not only computing education. It is discussed in literature broadly, though the focus is on technical implementation details. These tools mostly lack the capability to provide individual feedback to learners and can only assess whether an example was correct or not.\textit{Jack, Praktomat}

Using these opportunities to help increase the interactivity of a course, make the skills learned more applicable to real-world problems, and therefore help learners to get the most from a Massive Open Online Course. 

In this thesis, a novel approach to the Assessment of Programming Code using Natural Language Processing (NLP) is developed and assessed. This concept is technically and didactically integrated with a newly developed MOOC course based on an in-person practical course on Machine Learning.
