# A global pandemic and MOOCs - a perspective on learning new skills virtually

With a global pandemic making learning in person impossible, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) have seen a spike in popularity. The Vision of MOOCS is simple: Let learners across all ages, countries, and walks of life gain new skills by learning virtually. A life-long, life-accompanying on-demand learning fueled by the democratization of education. 

But this promise of breaking down obstacles is often broken. In reality, most courses are created top-down with the teacher in the center and lack real human interaction, especially when providing assessment and feedback. [@yousef2015effective]

Evaluating Assignments by using automatic tools is already widely used in not only computing education. It is discussed in literature broadly, though the focus is on technical implementation details. These tools mostly lack the capability to provide individual feedback to learners and can only assess whether an example was correct or not.\todowrite{Source: Praktomat,JACK}

Using these opportunities to help increase the interactivity of a course, make the skills learned more applicable to real-world problems, and therefore help learners to get the most from a Massive Open Online Course. 

In this thesis, a novel approach to the Assessment of Programming Code using Natural Language Processing (NLP) is developed and assessed. This concept is technically and didactically integrated with a newly developed MOOC course based on an in-person practical course on Machine Learning.
